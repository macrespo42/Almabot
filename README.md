# Almabot !

This project is a Discord bot designed to help users get the Almanax offerings for the current day, week, or even the next week.
The Almanax is a daily quest in the MMORPG [Dofus](https://www.dofus.com/en), where each day you need to offer an item to a different god.
If you complete the quest every day for a year (365 times), you will receive a precious dragon egg!

## Why ?

It's annoying to log in to the game every day, start the quest, go to the nearest shop to buy the required item,
and then return to the temple to give the offering to the daily god. I wanted something that could provide
the Almanax offerings for the entire week so I can buy all the needed items in advance and speed up the process.
I chose to create a Discord bot instead of a script so that my friends and guildmates can use it too.

## üöÄ Quickstart
